# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Correctly detect file extensions for records whose names contain dots (e.g. `my.Widget.js`) by using `path.extname` instead of splitting on the first dot. This fixes wrong field/extension mapping during build and push.
- `dev` mode no longer crashes when `refreshInterval` is set to `0` (disable polling); `getRefresh()` now treats `0` as a valid value.
- `SNFileExists` now escapes and anchors the record-name regex, preventing false matches and regex errors for names containing special characters.

### Changed

- Removed dead, duplicated file-path parsing helpers (`parseFileNameParams`, `getParsedFilesPayload`) so `getFileContextFromPath` is the single source of truth.
- Minor cleanups: removed redundant `try/catch` rethrows and fixed a user-facing typo ("Recieved" → "Received").
